it	O

that	O

Adding	O
further	O
weight	O
to	O
the	O

of	O

argument	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

complex	O
,	O
particularly	O
as	O
applied	O
to	O
commercial	O
and	O
'	O
non-linear	O
'	O
properties	O
.	O

I	O
deal	O
with	O
assessment	O
appeals	O
(	O
though	O
not	O
in	O
New	B-New_Jersey
Jersey	I-New_Jersey
)	O
and	O
thus	O
have	O
some	O
general	O
background	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
.	O

Every	O
jurisdiction	O
has	O
it	O
's	O
own	O
rules	O
and	O
regs	O
as	O
relates	O
to	O
assessment	O
and	O
taxation	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
pretense	O
toward	O
knowing	O
what	O
these	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
NJ	B-New_Jersey
.	O

In	O
general	O
terms	O
,	O
commercial	O
buildings	O
and	O
non	O
linear	O
property	O
(	O
things	O
like	O
trains	O

utility	O
distribution	O

)	O
are	O
not	O

(	O
as	O

)	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
pretty	O
obvious	O
,	O
given	O
that	O
these	O
types	O
of	O
properties	O
tend	O
to	O
sell	O
infrequently	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
price	O

the	O
cost	O
to	O

or	O

the	O

on	O
it	O
's	O

and	O

is	O
n't	O
always	O
what	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
currently	O
used	O
for	O
...	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
an	O
old	O
barn	O
on	O
10	O
acres	O
of	O
land	O
in	O
mid	O
town	O
Manhattan	B-Manhattan
,	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
paying	O
taxes	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
the	O
farmland	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
what	O
it	O
would	O
sell	O
for	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
presently	O
on	O
the	O
market	O
and	O
zoned	O
for	O
a	O
use	O
consistent	O
with	O
it	O
's	O

)	O
.	O

Some	O
types	O
of	O
commercial	O
property	O
are	O
valued	O
based	O
on	O
annual	O
income	O
(	O
or	O
potential	O
)	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
common	O
method	O
for	O
rental	O
and	O
hotel	O
properties	O

We	O
would	O
need	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
method	O
(	O
s	O
)	O
the	O
assessor	O
used	O
to	O
arrive	O
at	O
an	O
accurate	O
explanation	O
for	O
the	O
value	O
given	O
for	O
this	O
particular	O
land	O
and	O
building	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
assume	O
RBA	B-Reserve_Bank_of_Australia
has	O
been	O
assessed	O
based	O
on	O
it	O
's	O
income	O
potential	O

Although	O
it	O
may	O
seem	O
counter-intuitive	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
uncommon	O
for	O
multimillion	O
dollar	O

(	O

other	O
types	O
of	O

to	O

10-20	O
%	O
of	O
their	O
construction	O
cost	O
-	O
even	O
when	O
they	O
seem	O
practically	O
new	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
the	O
income	O
generating	O
ability	O
of	O
the	O
building	O
itself	O
as	O
a	O
standalone	O

)	O

In	O
the	O
rare	O
instances	O
where	O
these	O
facilities	O
are	O
sold	O
(	O
generally	O
by	O
the	O
municipality	O
that	O
built	O
and	O

them	O

they	O

sell	O
for	O
a	O
value	O
not	O

from	O
the	O
"	O
10-20	O
%	O
"	O
value	O
mentioned	O
above	O
-	O
sometimes	O
much	O
less	O
(	O

,	O
the	O
club	O

for	O

building	O
(	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
)	O
and	O
are	O
the	O
owners	O
of	O
same	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
subject	O
to	O
any	O
tax	O
burden	O
deemed	O
payable	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
(	O
assuming	O
the	O
present	O
judgment	O
is	O
n't	O
reversed	O

regardless	O
of	O
what	O
other	O
tenants	O
might	O
be	O
present	O
or	O
events	O
may	O
be	O
held	O
.	O

This	O
amount	O
could	O
be	O
reduced	O
if	O
,	O
for	O
example	O

the	O

owners	O

As	O

they	O

Mr.	O

asked	O
about	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
fill	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
build	O
this	O
project	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Trakimas	O
responded	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
house	O
lots	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
built	O
it	O
would	O
require	O
7000	O
cubic	O
yards	O
of	O
cut	O
and	O
17000	O
cubic	O
yards	O
of	O
fill	O

To	O
bring	O
in	O
the	O
fill	O
would	O
require	O
400-600	O
dump	O

fill	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
site	O

Susan	O

pointed	O
out	O
that	O
if	O
houses	O
were	O
to	O

built	O
on	O
these	O

they	O
would	O
require	O
a	O

from	O

by-law	O
in	O
that	O
the	O

Global	O

in	O
two	O

Over	O
the	O
past	O
week	O
I	O
have	O
talked	O
to	O
various	O
people	O
about	O
events	O
in	O
my	O

The	O
word	O
“	O

keeps	O
getting	O
thrown	O
around	O
to	O
describe	O
my	O

I	O
am	O
always	O

I	O
do	O

generally	O
think	O

people	O
in	O

of	O
their	O
actions	O
being	O

it	O

that	O

my	O

when	O

I	O

So	O
my	O
research	O
this	O

the	O

What	O
it	O

How	O
would	O
I	O
recognize	O

First	O

Second	O
,	O
is	O
the	O

Think	O

is	O

that	O
you	O

it	O

,	O
it	O
is	O

to	O

with	O

off	O

Each	O
one	O

would	O

for	O

with	O

Despite	O

of	O

In	O
terms	O
of	O

the	O

four	O

enhancements	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
the	O
introduction	O
of	O
the	O
Photo	O
Sprayer	O
tool	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O

typical	O

bitmap	O
objects	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
flowers	O
and	O

butterflies	O
,	O
onto	O
your	O
image	O
.	O

Again	O
the	O
control	O
on	O
offer	O
is	O
surprisingly	O

advanced	O
with	O
customisable	O
size	O
,	O
spread	O
and	O
opacity	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
also	O
create	O

your	O
own	O
nozzles	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
is	O
a	O
reworking	O
of	O
the	O
existing	O
PhotoTapestry	O

effect	O
.	O

This	O
takes	O
an	O
image	O
and	O
recreates	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
tiles	O
based	O

on	O
the	O
collection	O
of	O
30,000	O
supplied	O
thumbnails	O
.	O

Now	O
you	O
can	O
add	O
your	O

own	O
image	O
to	O
the	O
tile	O
set	O
or	O
create	O
a	O
new	O
set	O
from	O
scratch	O
-	O
though	O
this	O

is	O
only	O
practical	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
plenty	O
of	O
images	O
and	O
plenty	O
of	O
disk	O
space	O
!	O

Much	O
the	O
most	O
impressive	O
new	O
feature	O
is	O
the	O
complete	O
overhaul	O
of	O
PhotoSuite	O
's	O

Stitching	O
capabilities	O
based	O
on	O
PhotoVista	O
technology	O
MGI	O
acquired	O
from	O

LivePicture	O
.	O

Now	O
you	O
can	O
create	O
seamless	O
panoramas	O
simply	O
by	O
dragging	O

up	O
to	O
48	O
images	O
onto	O
the	O
main	O
image	O
window	O
,	O
roughly	O
positioning	O
them	O
and	O

then	O
selecting	O
your	O
camera	O
lens	O
type	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
even	O
choose	O
to	O
create	O
360-degree	O

immersive	O
panoramas	O
.	O

Generally	O
the	O
process	O
is	O
simple	O
and	O
the	O
results	O
are	O

impressive	O
and	O
you	O
could	O
easily	O
expect	O
to	O
pay	O
more	O
for	O
less	O
powerful	O
dedicated	O

stitching	O
software	O
.	O

The	O
Stitching	O
feature	O
is	O
excellent	O
for	O
building	O
up	O

panoramas	O
.	O

The	O
fourth	O
new	O
editing	O
advance	O
is	O
the	O
improvement	O
in	O
what	O
PhotoSuite	O

calls	O
its	O
"	O
cut-out	O
"	O
handling	O
.	O

Essentially	O
a	O
cut-out	O
is	O
any	O
selection	O
of	O

the	O
image	O
that	O
you	O
make	O
using	O
the	O
various	O
marquee	O
,	O
magic	O
wand	O
and	O
edge	O

finder	O
tools	O
and	O
then	O
float	O
above	O
the	O
underlying	O
image	O
.	O

Now	O
cut-outs	O
can	O

be	O
stored	O
by	O
quickly	O
sending	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Library	B-Library
or	O
by	O
saving	O
them	O
to	O

file	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
also	O
now	O
change	O
the	O
edge	O
fading	O
and	O
the	O
overall	O
opacity	O

of	O
the	O
cut-out	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
seem	O
a	O
more	O
integral	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
underlying	O

image	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
a	O
step	O
forward	O
but	O
PhotoSuite	O
definitely	O

is	O
n't	O
the	O
right	O
program	O
for	O
producing	O
advanced	O
layer-based	O
compositions	O
.	O

Instead	O
its	O
cut-outs	O
are	O
better	O
seen	O
as	O
object-based	O
props	O
and	O
indeed	O

PhotoSuite	O
provides	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
props	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
hats	O
and	O
hair	O
,	O
for	O
producing	O

photo-based	O
projects	O
in	O
its	O
Compose	O
module	O
.	O

The	O
obvious	O
use	O
is	O
for	O
producing	O

humorous	O
cards	O
and	O
generally	O
having	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
fun	O
but	O
,	O
amongst	O
its	O
selection	O

of	O
over	O
1200	O
templates	O
,	O
PhotoSuite	O
also	O
includes	O
some	O
high-resolution	O

business	O
options	O
for	O
producing	O
calendars	O
,	O
posters	O
,	O
business	O
cards	O
and	O

so	O
on	O
.	O

The	O
Compose	O
module	O
offers	O
thousands	O
of	O
photo-based	O

projects	O
.	O

Once	O
you	O
've	O
finished	O
preparing	O
your	O
photo	O
or	O
your	O
project	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
step	O

is	O

Shooting	O
at	O

at	O
one	O

shooting	O

O'Rourke	B-Mary_O'Rourke

one	O

by	O

many	O

O’Rourke	O

viewing	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

the	O

remains	O
very	O
much	O
my	O

responsibility	O

I	O
stand	O
by	O
what	O
I	O
said	O
in	O
the	O
documentary	O
about	O
Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen
because	O
it	O
sums	O
up	O
much	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
book	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
appalling	O
legacy	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
taoiseach	O
who	O
oversaw	O
the	O
rushed	O
introduction	O
of	O
the	O
bank	O
guarantee	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
surrendered	O
economic	O
sovereignty	O
,	O
as	O
happened	O
last	O
November	O
.	O

His	O
performance	O
prior	O
to	O
becoming	O
taoiseach	O
,	O
during	O
his	O
time	O
as	O
finance	O
minister	O
,	O
was	O
appalling	O
too	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
hindsight	O
:	O
I	O
wrote	O
in	O
April	O
2008	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
becoming	O
leader	O
of	O
Fianna	O
Fáil	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
enormous	O
amount	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
garlands	O

being	O
thrown	O
his	O
way	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
performance	O
as	O
finance	O

had	O
not	O
been	O
impressive	O
.	O

I	O
go	O
into	O
greater	O
detail	O
in	O
the	O
book	O
,	O
particularly	O
about	O
what	O
others	O
have	O
told	O
me	O
about	O
Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen
’s	O
behaviour	O
while	O
in	O
office	O
.	O

The	O
obvious	O
manifestation	O
of	O
the	O
psychological	O
pressure	O
he	O
suffered	O
was	O
his	O
drinking	O
of	O
alcohol	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
little	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen
did	O
not	O
exhibit	O
sufficient	O
care	O
about	O
his	O
drinking	O
while	O
in	O
office	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
his	O
way	O
of	O
releasing	O

pressure	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
middle-aged	O
man	O

his	O
responsibilities	O

excessive	O
weight	O

previous	O
health	O

of	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
his	O

should	O
not	O
have	O
behaved	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
during	O
a	O
national	O
crisis	O

He	O
needed	O
all	O

his	O

what	O
about	O
Lenihan	B-Brian_Lenihan_Jnr

off-limits	O
to	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
danger	O
that	O
sympathy	O

his	O
personal	O

can	O
lead	O
to	O

examination	O
of	O
his	O

His	O

Lenihan	B-Brian_Lenihan_Jnr

Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen

the	O
end	O
of	O

as	O
if	O
it	O
was	O

the	O

skills	O
that	O
Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen
himself	O
lacked	O

Lenihan	B-Brian_Lenihan_Jnr
got	O

some	O
respects	O
because	O
he	O

that	O

Also	O
he	O
was	O

of	O
the	O

as	O
a	O
full	O
minister	O
until	O
after	O
the	O

Ahern	B-Bertie_Ahern

to	O
get	O
up	O
to	O

quickly	O
on	O

but	O
he	O
can	O

of	O

of	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
about	O
the	O

"	O

with	O
his	O

with	O

I	O
remember	O
him	O

with	O
me	O
in	O
early	O

as	O
I	O
pressed	O

He	O
blamed	O

Lenihan	B-Brian_Lenihan_Jnr
and	O
Cowen	B-Brian_Cowen
found	O
that	O
their	O
reward	O
for	O

all	O

them	O

it	O

that	O

the	O

To	O
a	O

it	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
feel	O

for	O

the	O

INTRODUCTION	O
:	O

The	O
UK	B-United_Kingdom
's	O
system	O
of	O
company	O
law	O
and	O
corporate	O
governance	O
,	O
setting	O
out	O
the	O
legal	O
basis	O
on	O
which	O
companies	O
are	O
formed	O
and	O
run	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
vital	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
legal	O
framework	O
within	O
which	O
business	O
is	O
conducted	O
.	O

But	O
over	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
Companies	O
Acts	O
1985	O
and	O
1989	O
have	O
become	O
convoluted	O
and	O
unwieldy	O
to	O
understand	O
as	O
successive	O
amendments	O
were	O
made	O
and	O
changes	O
emanating	O
from	O
Europe	B-Europe
impacted	O
on	O
our	O
domestic	O
law	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
Companies	B-Companies_Act_2006
Act	I-Companies_Act_2006
2006	I-Companies_Act_2006
is	O
a	O
consolidating	O
piece	O
of	O
legislation	O
which	O
will	O
codify	O
and	O
re-arrange	O
existing	O
regulation	O
into	O
a	O
more	O
readily	O
understandable	O
and	O
comprehensive	O
source	O
of	O
law	O
whilst	O
giving	O
effect	O
to	O
new	O
aspects	O
of	O
regulation	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
's	O
reform	O
agenda	O
.	O

In	O
broad	O
terms	O
,	O
the	O
Act	B-Companies_Act_2006
is	O
designed	O
to	O
promote	O
shareholder	O
engagement	O
and	O
a	O
long-term	O
investment	O
culture	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
introduce	O
new	O
provisions	O
for	O
small	O
companies	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
making	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
and	O
run	O
a	O
company	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
also	O
introduces	O
new	O
requirements	O
around	O
narrative	O
and	O
performance	O
reporting	O
for	O
all	O
but	O
the	O
smallest	O
of	O

Helpfully	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
codifying	O
the	O
requirements	O
of	O
the	O
EU	O
Accounts	O
Modernisation	O
Directive	O
the	O
Act	B-Companies_Act_2006
ends	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
following	O
the	O
withdrawal	O
of	O

Financial	O

(	O
OFR	O
)	O
which	O
was	O
abruptly	O
abandoned	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
November	O
2005	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
demise	O
of	O
the	O
OFR	O
,	O
the	O
government	O
has	O
re-affirmed	O
its	O
commitment	O
to	O
“	O
encouraging	O
meaningful	O
strategic	O
,	O
forward-looking	O
information	O
to	O
assist	O
shareholder	O
engagement	O
”	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
notable	O
differences	O
between	O
the	O
narrative	O
reporting	O
provisions	O
of	O
the	O
Act	B-Companies_Act_2006
and	O
the	O
OFR	O
it	O
replaces	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
although	O
auditors	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
report	O
on	O
the	O
consistency	O
of	O
the	O
Directors	O
'	O
Report	O
with	O
the	O
annual	O
accounts	O
(	O
as	O
is	O
required	O
by	O
the	O
Accounts	O
Modernisation	O
Directive	O
)	O
there	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
any	O
additional	O
requirement	O
to	O
check	O
for	O
other	O
inconsistencies	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
all	O
companies	O
will	O
be	O
exempted	O
from	O
disclosing	O
in	O
the	O
Business	O
Review	O
information	O
which	O
is	O
seriously	O
prejudicial	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
interests	O
.	O

This	O
exemption	O
was	O
previously	O
only	O
provided	O
for	O
companies	O
that	O
had	O
to	O
produce	O
an	O
OFR	O
;	O
and	O
finally	O
,	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O

to	O
the	O
status	O
of	O
a	O

best	O
practice	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
Act	B-Companies_Act_2006
is	O
much	O
less	O
prescriptive	O
than	O
RS1	O
about	O
the	O
information	O
to	O
be	O
disclosed	O
when	O
reporting	O
KPIs	O
.	O

One	O
important	O
change	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
gone	O
unnoticed	O
by	O
many	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
requirements	O
for	O
narrative	O
reporting	O
have	O
been	O
streamlined	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
obligations	O
for	O

companies	O
are	O
now	O
more	O
closely	O
aligned	O
to	O
those	O
for	O
unquoted	O
companies	O
.	O

The	O
effect	O
is	O
that	O

)	O
and	O
not	O
just	O

Unfortunately	O

Making	O

all	O
of	O
this	O
data	O
presents	O
significant	O
management	O
and	O
IT	O
challenges	O
,	O
particularly	O
as	O
the	O
reporting	O
landscape	O
is	O
constantly	O
changing	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
new	O
reporting	O
requirements	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
a	O
possible	O
lack	O
of	O
consistency	O
in	O
reporting	O
seriously	O
jeopardises	O
the	O
reliability	O
of	O
reporting	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
the	O
EBR	O
,	O
independent	O
auditors	O
have	O
to	O
attest	O
that	O
the	O
claims	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
Business	O
Review	O
are	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O
financial	O
statements	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
both	O
management	O
and	O
auditors	O
need	O
certainty	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
a	O
financial	O
KPI	O
reported	O
in	O
the	O
EBR	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Return	O

(	O
ROCE	O
)	O
is	O
completely	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O

a	O
scorecard	O
,	O
the	O
monthly	O
board	O
pack	O
and	O
the	O
current	O

So	O
integration	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
performance	O
reporting	O
and	O
compliance	O
with	O
the	O
EBR	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
only	O
through	O

applications	O
that	O

can	O
be	O

that	O
the	O

Zinc	B-Zinc
better	O
reflects	O
the	O

of	O

than	O
the	O
Dr	O
Copper	B-Copper
.	O

In	O
July	O
2008	O
copper	O
was	O
making	O
new	O
highs	O
(	O
with	O
oil	O
)	O
,	O
when	O
zinc	O
had	O
long-since	O
turned	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
credit	O

was	O
in	O
full	O
flight.In	O
early	O
2011	O
,	O
copper	O
made	O
new	O

again	O
,	O
above	O
2006	O
and	O
2007	O
levels	O
--	O
when	O
the	O
real	O

was	O
in	O
a	O
more	O

state	O
.	O

Here	O
's	O
a	O
chart	O
of	O
copper	O
over	O
that	O
period	O
.	O

To	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
less	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
the	O
economy	O
and	O
more	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
the	O
speculative	O
excess	O
at	O
the	O
extreme	O
end	O
of	O
finance.So	O
what	O
is	O
zinc	O
telling	O
us	O
now?It	O
has	O
turned	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
see	O
some	O
buying	O
coming	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
junior	O
mining	O
end	O
of	O
markets	O
,	O
so	O
perhaps	O
we	O
can	O
expect	O
this	O
rally	O
to	O
continue	O
until	O
Christmas	B-Christmas
and	O
even	O
into	O

But	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O
problems	O
lurking	O
on	O
the	O

as	O
we	O
all	O

I	O
would	O
be	O

to	O

And	O
I	O
'll	O
be	O
watching	O
closely	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
zinc	O
price	O
provides	O
an	O

is	O
more	O
of	O
a	O

than	O
it	O

I	O
look	O

seeing	O
what	O
the	O
group	O
consensus	O
will	O
be	O
on	O
this	O
topic	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
idea	O
has	O
some	O
merit	O
but	O
I	O
’m	O
not	O
totally	O
sold	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
need	O
to	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
about	O
how	O
the	O
overall	O
concept	O
would	O
be	O
implemented	O
and	O
developed	O
over	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
give	O
it	O
my	O
tick	O
of	O
approval	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
the	O
government	O
values	O
my	O
opinion	O

As	O
an	O
ex-fatty	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
appreciated	O
a	O
little	O
short-term	O
pain	O
for	O
some	O

The	O
argument	O
supporting	O
school	O
weigh-ins	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
different	O
from	O
ear	O
tests	O
and	O
eye	O
tests	O
etc.	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
a	O
school	O
teacher	O
and	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
huge	O
difference	O
.	O

Children	O
compare	O
results	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
care	O
very	O
little	O
between	O
their	O
hearing	O
and	O
sight	O
tests	O
compared	O
to	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
would	O
about	O
weight	O
.	O

Please	O
remember	O
how	O
competetive	O
children	O
are	O
and	O
how	O
cruel	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
in	O
their	O
comparisons	O
that	O
would	O
inevitably	O
result	O
from	O
these	O
weigh-ins	O

this	O

I	O

about	O

him	O

instead	O
of	O

through	O

is	O

to	O
help	O
him	O
too	O
much	O
and	O
he	O
is	O
11	O
years	O

She	O
has	O
lined	O
him	O
up	O
with	O
my	O
PT	B-Pacific_Time_Zone
(	O
who	O
is	O
great	O

’ll	O
keep	O
him	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
he	O
’s	O
also	O
shown	O
an	O

in	O
a	O

hopefully	O
he	O
’ll	O
start	O

I	O

but	O
the	O
information	O
needs	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
parents	O
are	O

for	O
what	O

I	O
have	O

my	O

to	O
a	O
very	O

The	O

adjustments	O
to	O

were	O
the	O

I	O
made	O

excercising	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O

they	O
had	O

But	O
if	O
you	O

of	O
asked	O
my	O
2	O
years	O
ago	O
,	O
was	O
my	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
NO	O
WAY	O

but	O
to	O
look	O

he	O
really	O

Hi	O
Craig	O

A	O
new	O

just	O
been	O
launched	O
in	O
New	B-New_South_Wales
South	I-New_South_Wales
Wales	I-New_South_Wales

over	O

a	O

(	O

perhaps	O

)	O

for	O
themselves	O

their	O

It	O
’s	O
a	O
little	O
like	O
the	O
Premier	B-Premier

I	O
feel	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
far	O
more	O
positive	O
approach	O
than	O
the	O
big	O
weigh-in	O

One	O
should	O
reward	O
good	O

rather	O
than	O
humiliate	O

for	O

I	O
would	O

As	O
a	O

I	O
feel	O
that	O
we	O
expect	O
schools	O
to	O
solve	O
all	O
of	O
society	O
’s	O
problems	O
and	O
relieve	O
parents	O

A	O

Hi	O

A	O
thought	O
from	O
up	O
here	O

Iceland	B-Iceland

Here	O
we	O
have	O
weighed	O
and	O
measured	O
height	O
for	O
9	O
year	O
old	O
children	O
since	O
about	O

I	O
think	O

these	O

the	O

a	O

the	O

we	O

so	O
many	O
other	O
contries	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
numbers	O
are	O
going	O
up	O
.	O

I	O
personally	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
both	O
the	O
child	O
and	O
the	O
parent	O
to	O
get	O
this	O

Children	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O

about	O
the	O

and	O
see	O
that	O

can	O

what	O

which	O

I	O
think	O
a	O
‘	O

would	O
only	O
be	O

As	O

let	O
’s	O
focus	O
on	O
physical	O

that	O
encourage	O

get	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
daughter	O
(	O
now	O
26	O
)	O
who	O
was	O
anorexic	O
in	O

early	O

due	O

As	O
we	O

for	O

the	O

there	O

a	O

talking	O
to	O
my	O

here	O

the	O

it	O
would	O
probably	O
at	O

end	O
up	O
with	O
me	O

several	O

Going	O
round	O
on	O
the	O
tour	O
bus	O
Im	B-Instant_messaging
not	O
saying	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
were	O
being	O
overly	O
cautious	O
but	O
based	O
more	O
on	O
travelling	O
between	O
tourist	O
areas	O
than	O
the	O
tourist	O
areas	O
themselves	O
.	O

The	O
bus	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
hop-on	O
hop-off	O
affairs	O
and	O
it	O
takes	O
about	O
3	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
hours	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
circuit	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
day	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
dull	O
and	O
overcast	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

Typical	O
,	O
the	O
day	O
I	O
’m	O
fit	O
and	O
well	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
a	O
major	O
photo	O
session	O
its	O
the	O
first	O
real	O
overcast	O
day	O
we	O
’ve	O

Of	O
course	O
the	O
weather	O
forecast	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
stay	O
in	O
BA	O
is	O
thunderstorms	O
so	O
manana	O
doesnt	O
really	O
quite	O
cut	O
it	O

So	O
the	O
plan	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
completely	O
sad	O
and	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
bus	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
circuit	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
weather	O
improved	O
.	O

This	O
involved	O
no	O
more	O
effort	O
than	O
sticking	O
the	O
elbow	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bus	O
and	O
lying	O
back	O

Of	O
course	O
sticking	O
the	O
elbow	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bus	O
was	O
precisely	O
how	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
perfect	O
triangle	O
of	O
peeling	O
tan	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
elbow	O
.	O

by	O
now	O
of	O
course	O
this	O
is	O
now	O
redder	O
and	O
deeper	O
but	O
thats	O
another	O
story	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
noticed	O
about	O
our	O
newly	O
arrived	O
open	O
top	O
bus	O
was	O
that	O
it	O
wasnt	O
open	O
topped	O
.	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
rain	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
and	O
people	O
got	O
wet	O
and	O
complained	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
money	O
back	O
.	O

The	O
bus	O
company	O
had	O
then	O
put	O
the	O
bolt	O
on	O
rooves	O
on	O
.	O

Great	O
to	O
stop	O
you	O
getting	O
wet	O
,	O
rubbish	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
bus	O
and	O
look	O
all	O
around	O
you	O
.	O

To	O
those	O
people	O
who	O
complained	O
about	O
getting	O
wet	O
in	O
the	O
rain	O
on	O
an	O
open	O
topped	O
bus	O
I	O
can	O
probably	O
guess	O
your	O
nationality	O
,	O
but	O
sure	O
come	O
to	O
Belfast	B-Belfast
,	O
our	O
open	O
top	O
busses	O
have	O
a	O
forcefield	O
that	O
deflects	O
rain	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
all	O
around	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
worst	O
weather	O
.	O

Just	O
remember	O
its	O
pay	O
in	O
advance	O
and	O
absolutely	O
no	O
refunds	O
and	O
dont	O
beleive	O
everything	O
you	O
read	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
.	O

So	O
of	O
course	O
I	O
managed	O
to	O
pick	O
the	O
wrong	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bus	O
,	O
the	O
row	O
with	O
no	O
working	O
headphones	O
and	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
speakers	O
behind	O
me	O
blasting	O
out	O
the	O
spanish	O
tour	O
information	O
would	O
have	O
drowned	O
them	O
out	O
anyway	O
.	O

No-one	O
thought	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
high	O
volume	O
setting	O
might	O
need	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
a	O
bit	O
now	O
theres	O
a	O
roof	O
on	O

But	O
still	O
very	O
little	O
to	O
see	O
in	O
the	O
dull	O
grey	O
light	O
anyway	O
and	O
even	O
less	O
to	O

no-one	O

I	O

we	O

to	O

it	O

the	O

indeed	O
pervaded	O
all	O
of	O
the	O

who	O
deemed	O
it	O
safer	O
just	O
to	O
sit	O

the	O

I	O

a	O

in	O

was	O
a	O
tourist	O

who	O
sat	O
over	O

both	O
at	O

For	O

they	O
sat	O
with	O
their	O
backpacks	O
on	O
the	O
spare	O
seats	O

them	O

People	O
would	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
deck	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
free	O
seats	O
and	O
they	O
both	O
would	O
ruffle	O
about	O
in	O
their	O
bag	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
as	O
much	O

as	O

The	O

had	O
a	O
wee	O
point	O
and	O
shoot	O

with	O
a	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
rude	O
of	O

not	O

what	O
he	O
was	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
dirty	O
old	O
man	O

Every	O
time	O
we	O

he	O
would	O
use	O

But	O
they	O
took	O

down	O

up	O

theres	O
no	O

this	O

The	O

down	O
around	O
La	B-La_Boca

it	O
goes	O
through	O

the	O

not	O
to	O

Of	O

these	O
are	O
the	O
areas	O
with	O
the	O
friendliest	O
people	O
,	O
waving	O
and	O
smiling	O
at	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
the	O

The	O
weather	O
was	O
picking	O
up	O
as	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
first	O
circuit	O
so	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
bus	O
and	O
go	O
round	O
again	O
and	O
get	O
off	O
at	O
Recoleta	O
,	O
famous	O
for	O
us	O
primarily	O
as	O
the	O
area	O
containing	O
the	O
Recoleta	O
cemetary	O
and	O
the	O
tomb	O
of	O
Evita	O
Peron	O
.	O

The	O
bus	O
stops	O
outside	O
the	O
tourist	O
office	O
and	O
theres	O
a	O
half	O
hour	O
wait	O
before	O
it	O
continues	O
so	O
we	O
chatted	O
and	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
the	O
bus	O
,	O
get	O
some	O
photos	O
of	O
the	O
nearby	O
Plaza	O
De	O
Mayo	O
before	O
we	O
set	O
off	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
the	O
driver	O
and	O
guide	O
had	O
nicked	O
off	O
for	O
a	O
mate	O
and	O
a	O
smoke	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
locked	O
in	O
,	O
something	O
they	O
dont	O
tell	O
you	O
so	O
be	O
warned	O

So	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
confession	O
to	O
make	O
,	O
well	O
not	O
a	O
confession	O
of	O
sorts	O
but	O
more	O
an	O
explanation	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
work	O
.	O

I	O
love	O
getting	O
all	O
the	O
tourist	O
literature	O
from	O
a	O
place	O
and	O
going	O
through	O
all	O
the	O
photos	O
and	O
comparing	O
whats	O
in	O
the	O
brochures	O
to	O
whats	O
actually	O
there	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
photograph	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
Ireland	B-Ireland
at	O
dawn	O
I	O
would	O
scout	O
out	O
the	O
location	O
,	O
pick	O
a	O
good	O
morning	O
with	O
relevant	O
clouds	O
,	O
pick	O
area	O
,	O
pick	O
spot	O
,	O
get	O
there	O
well	O
before	O
dawn	O
,	O
get	O
photos	O
,	O
come	O
home	O
,	O
review	O
etc	O
etc.	O
.	O

This	O
might	O
take	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
goes	O
due	O
to	O
changing	O
weather	O
conditions	O
,	O
some	O
moron	O
has	O

a	O
white	O
van	O
in	O
the	O
wrong	O
spot	O

or	O
any	O
multitude	O
of	O
things	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
finished	O
images	O
could	O
have	O
taken	O
weeks	O
of	O
research	O
and	O
maybe	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

to	O
get	O
the	O

when	O

judging	O
by	O

it	O

probably	O
the	O

I	O
could	O

did	O
a	O

more	O

rather	O
than	O
just	O

I	O
do	O
get	O
bad	O

from	O

to	O

thing	O
about	O

I	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
a	O
stock	O
photo	O
shoot	O
on	O
Weds	O
evening	O
I	O
just	O
didnt	O
feel	O
well	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

Suddenly	O
started	O
getting	O
twinges	O
in	O
my	O
lower	O
back	O
.	O

Now	O
Ive	B-Jony_Ive
had	O
them	O
before	O
but	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
getting	O
sick	O
in	O
another	O
foreign	O
country	O
really	O
didnt	O
appeal	O
.	O

A	O
quick	O
trip	O
to	O
the	O
loo	O
and	O
it	O
confirmed	O
that	O
another	O
bout	O
of	O
kidney	O
stones	O
was	O
on	O
its	O
way	O
rapidly	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
kid	O
I	O
remember	O
my	O
dad	O
being	O
plagued	O
by	O
them	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
Id	B-Identity_document
get	O
them	O
at	O
some	O
point	O
.	O

Although	O
looking	O
back	O
you	O
just	O
dont	O
realise	O
the	O
pain	O
people	O
are	O
in	O
until	O
you	O
feel	O
it	O
for	O
yourself	O
.	O

Those	O
of	O
you	O
that	O
know	O
me	O
will	O
also	O
know	O
Ive	B-Jony_Ive
been	O
taking	O
painkillers	O
almost	O
constantly	O
for	O
11	O
years	O
now	O
due	O
to	O
an	O
old	O
recurring	O
injury	O
.	O

All	O
that	O
extra	O
calcium	O
probably	O
doesnt	O
help	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
refrained	O
from	O
blogging	O
and	O
facebooking	O
about	O
being	O
painkiller/tablet	O
free	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
heat	O
and	O
humidity	O
for	O
12	O
days	O
(	O
until	O
the	O
antihistamine	O
mosquito	O
bites	O
incidents	O
last	O
week	O
)	O
because	O
I	O
knew	O
it	O
would	O
set	O
me	O
up	O
for	O
a	O
fall	O
.	O

Now	O
those	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
have	O
had	O
kidney	O
stones	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
just	O
pass	O
with	O
minor	O
irritation	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
it	O
feels	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
piss	O
a	O
concrete	O
block	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
latter	O
.	O

Within	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
I	O
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
in	O
a	O
pool	O
of	O
sweat	O
trying	O
to	O
knock	O
the	O
co-codamol	O
into	O
me	O
as	O
quickly	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
manage	O
.	O

After	O
taking	O
the	O
recommended	O
dosage	O
for	O
8	O
hours	O
in	O
15	O
mins	O
it	O
had	O
eased	O
somewhat	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
try	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
shower	O
.	O

How	O
I	O
thought	O
this	O
would	O
help	O
I	O
didnt	O
know	O
but	O
I	O
certainly	O
wasnt	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
any	O
wetter	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
my	O
flatmates	O
had	O
noticed	O
my	O
absence	O
and	O
packed	O
up	O
the	O
gear	O
as	O
Id	B-Identity_document
just	O
left	O
the	O
camera	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
disappeared	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
them	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
to	O
a	O
doctor	O
.	O

After	O
2	O
hours	O
(	O
well	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
more	O
like	O
2	O
mins	O
)	O
I	O
noticed	O
them	O
in	O
discussion	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
outburst	O
was	O
‘	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
get	O
me	O
to	O
a	O

do	O
you	O
not	O

’	O

or	O
words	O
to	O
that	O
effect	O
,	O
there	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
slight	O
swearing	O
involved	O
.	O

Well	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
swearing	O
,	O
infact	O
every	O
2nd	O

Now	O
Im	B-Instant_messaging
not	O
one	O
for	O
panicking	O
,	O
I	O
rarely	O
panic	O
and	O
usually	O
in	O
the	O
worst	O
situations	O
can	O
still	O
think	O
logically	O
.	O

The	O
issue	O
my	O
friends	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
didnt	O
know	O
a	O
doctor	O
,	O
theyd	O
never	O
had	O
call	O
to	O
call	O
one	O
.	O

Not	O
like	O
my	O
poor	O
dad	O
who	O
often	O
commented	O
that	O
a	O
holiday	O
in	O
our	O
house	O
always	O
ended	O
up	O
with	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
us	O
visiting	O
the	O
local	O
accident	O
and	O
emergency	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
any	O
incident	O
my	O
dad	O
could	O
tell	O
you	O
which	O
doctors	O
was	O
open	O
,	O
which	O
hospital	O
was	O
on	O
A+E	O
intake	O
and	O
which	O
local	O
chemist	O
was	O
open	O
on	O
the	O
rota	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
again	O
,	O
interspersed	O
with	O
swearwords	O
I	O
requested	O
my	O
friends	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
nearest	O
flat	O
with	O
old	O
people	O
or	O
with	O
kids	O
as	O
they	O
invariably	O
would	O
know	O
where	O
the	O
nearest	O
doctor	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
building	O
porter	O
will	O
know	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
he	O
wouldnt	O
and	O
I	O
slightly	O
forcefully	O
told	O
them	O
to	O
at	O
least	O
walk	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
and	O
pretend	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O
as	O
I	O
asked	O
.	O

Poor	O
guys	O
didnt	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
Not	O
even	O
watching	O
rapper	O
videos	O
on	O
MTV	B-MTV
had	O
prepared	O
them	O
for	O
the	O
sheer	O
volume	O
of	O
swearing	O
an	O
irishman	O
in	O
excruciating	O
pain	O
can	O
muster	O
.	O

We	O
briefly	O
discussed	O
them	O
looking	O
up	O
my	O
travel	O
insurance	O
company	O
on	O
the	O
web	O
and	O
ringing	O
them	O
for	O
advice	O
.	O

I	O
finally	O
just	O
produced	O
every	O
bit	O
of	O
cash	O
I	O
owned	O
,	O
my	O
credit	O
cards	O
,	O
passport	O
and	O
doubled	O
over	O
in	O
the	O
hall	O
informed	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
leaving	O
for	O
the	O
nearest	O
hospital	O
and	O
to	O
summon	O
a	O
taxi	O

At	O
a	O
party	O
earlier	O
in	O
the	O
trip	O
someone	O
here	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
were	O
like	O
,	O
were	O
they	O
helpful	O
and	O
friendly	O
.	O

I	O
said	O
that	O
no	O
matter	O
where	O
I	O
went	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
seem	O
always	O
willing	O
to	O
help	O
a	O
stranger	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
the	O
example	O
in	O
a	O
recent	O
trip	O
to	O
Northern	O
Nicosia	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
lost	O
on	O
the	O
backstreets	O
and	O
my	O
leg	O
pain	O
had	O
increased	O
.	O

I	O
sat	O
down	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
tablet	O
and	O
drank	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
my	O
water	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Three	O
late	O
teenage	O
or	O
early	O
twenties	O
guys	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
‘	O
oh	O
shit	O
here	O
we	O
go	O
’	O
.	O

They	O
didnt	O
say	O
anything	O
just	O
smiled	O
and	O
handed	O
me	O
a	O
fruit	O
sweet	O
and	O
walked	O
off	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
nothing	O
like	O
the	O
kindness	O
of	O
strangers	O
,	O
particularly	O
alone	O
far	O
from	O
home	O

With	O
all	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
down	O
to	O
individuals	O

I	O
suffered	O
horrific	O
injuries	O
in	O
Kenya	B-Kenya
11	O
years	O
ago	O
,	O
injuries	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
left	O
someone	O

everyone	O
I	O
met	O
was	O

A	O

there	O
perhaps	O

In	O
what	O
seemed	O
like	O
an	O
eternity	O
a	O
taxi	O
arrived	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
whisked	O
at	O
the	O

only	O

drivers	O

how	O
to	O

to	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
given	O
a	O

and	O
told	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
seat	O
which	O
was	O
easier	O
said	O
than	O
done	O

From	O
home	O
experience	O
I	O
expected	O
to	O
wait	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
and	O
be	O
doubled	O
up	O
all	O

time	O

I	O

less	O

10	O

explained	O
the	O
situation	O
and	O
about	O
10	O
mins	O
later	O
had	O
the	O
much	O
needed	O
painkilling	O

10	O
mins	O
after	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
sort	O
of	O
back	O
to	O
normal	O
with	O
only	O
the	O
now	O
translucent	O
skin	O
colour	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
severe	O

probably	O
the	O

spots	O
of	O

I	O
had	O
were	O
now	O
the	O
remaining	O

Another	O
difference	O
from	O
home	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
doctor	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
tests	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
I	O
didnt	O
have	O
an	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
done	O
in	O
an	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
sent	O
home	O
with	O
the	O
all	O
clear	O

told	O
to	O
drink	O
as	O

as	O
I	O
could	O

down	O

over	O

at	O

back	O

was	O
subsiding	O
and	O

I	O

about	O

We	O

the	O

of	O

I	O
often	O

a	O
wingman/wingwoman/wingperson	O
to	O
watch	O
my	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
strange	O
place	O
whenever	O
Im	B-Instant_messaging
concentrating	O
on	O

and	O
actually	O

recognising	O
a	O
hood/crook/criminal	O
no	O
matter	O
where	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
always	O
pays	O
to	O

The	O
less	O

One	O
advantage	O
of	O

in	O

is	O
that	O
people	O
tend	O
not	O

My	O

about	O
how	O
he	O
went	O
into	O
London	B-London
one	O
night	O
and	O
won	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O
on	O
the	O

he	O
was	O
standing	O
in	O
the	O

early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
on	O
a	O
deserted	O
platform	O
with	O
the	O
money	O
in	O
his	O

A	O
group	O
of	O

arrived	O

my	O

having	O
worked	O
in	O
a	O
bookies	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

these	O

up	O

helping	O
the	O

taking	O
him	O

One	O
other	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
bus	O
in	O
Rome	B-Rome
and	O
this	O
girl	O
was	O
giving	O
her	O
what	O
I	O
assume	O
was	O
a	O
boyfriend	O
such	O
earache	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
high	O
volume	O
it	O
wasnt	O
hard	O
to	O
be	O
nosey	O
.	O

To	O
cut	O
the	O
long	O
story	O
short	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
walking	O
down	O
this	O
backstreet	O
in	O
Rome	B-Rome
which	O
they	O
shouldnt	O
really	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
approached	O
by	O
a	O
beautiful	O
early	O
20s	O
woman	O
.	O

She	O
walked	O
right	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
big	O
kiss	O
and	O
started	O
to	O
fondle	O
his	O
nuts	O
(	O
and	O
I	O
dont	O
mean	O
peanuts	O
)	O
.	O

The	O
guy	O
of	O
course	O
was	O
just	O
happy	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
for	O
the	O
ride	O
but	O
suddenly	O
she	O
walked	O
off	O
when	O
another	O
female	O
friend	O
appeared	O
.	O

The	O
girlfriend	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
too	O
gobsmacked	O
to	O
say	O
anything	O
and	O
our	O
hero	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
fit	O
state	O
to	O
argue	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
until	O
he	O
discovered	O
that	O
his	O
bumbag	O
(	O
fannypack	O
)	O
was	O
empty	O
and	O
hed	O
lost	O
their	O
money	O
,	O
passports	O
,	O
room	O
keys	O
,	O
everything	O
.	O

So	O
for	O
the	O
entire	O
bus	O
journey	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
town	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
bus	O
was	O
reminded	O
about	O
how	O
stupid	O
he	O
’d	O
been	O
.	O

I	O
cant	O
really	O
describe	O
the	O
look	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
taking	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
abuse	O
and	O
whilst	O
he	O
showed	O
shame	O
and	O
embarrassment	O
there	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
trace	O
of	O
a	O
smile	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

So	O
let	O
that	O
be	O
a	O
lesson	O
to	O
you	O
all	O
,	O
either	O
hide	O
your	O

The	O
theme	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
to	O
observe	O
the	O
impact	O
of	O
climate	O

and	O
to	O
see	O
what	O

On	O
the	O
one	O

We	O
heard	O

to	O
new	O
species	O
of	O

that	O
were	O
killing	O

were	O

about	O

in	O

A	O

a	O

What	O
was	O

was	O
to	O

how	O

had	O

to	O
create	O
a	O

to	O
protect	O
local	O

We	O
saw	O
how	O

harnessed	O
to	O
reduce	O

on	O
the	O

We	O
were	O

to	O

(	O

)	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
lots	O
of	O

enough	O
for	O
the	O
vast	O

Other	O
animals	O
are	O
n’t	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
Revelation	B-Book_of_Revelation
passages	O
,	O
presumably	O
because	O
they	O

But	O
is	O
n’t	O
it	O
likely	O
that	O
since	O
there	O
are	O
innumerable	O
horses	O
in	O
heaven	O
there	O
are	O
all	O

of	O

Why	O
would	O

Why	O
would	O
we	O
expect	O

If	O
there	O

In	O
Isaiah	B-Isaiah

God	B-God

to	O
creating	O
a	O

a	O

In	O

text	O
seems	O
to	O
move	O
back	O

forth	O
from	O
the	O

kingdom	O
to	O
the	O
New	B-New_Earth_(Christianity)

God	B-God

.	O

Some	O
also	O
argue	O
for	O
animals	O
being	O
in	O
heaven	O
based	O
on	O
Ecclesiastes	B-Ecclesiastes
3:19	O
-21	O
,	O
which	O
says	O
“	O
Man	B-Man
’s	O
fate	O
is	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
animals	O
...	O
all	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
.	O
”	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
larger	O
context	O
of	O
Ecclesiastes	O
Solomon	O
is	O
simply	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
outward	O
appearance	O
of	O
death	O
.	O

Men	O
and	O
animals	O
both	O
die	O
and	O
we	O
ca	O
n’t	O
see	O
where	O
they	O
go	O

Scripture	B-Religious_text
tells	O
us	O
elsewhere	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
man	O
has	O
an	O
eternal	O

It	O
tells	O
us	O
he	O
goes	O
one	O
of	O
two	O
places	O
at	O
death	O

Animals	O
are	O
not	O
said	O
to	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
said	O
to	O
relocate	O
when	O
they	O

The	O
presumption	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
at	O
death	O
they	O
cease	O
to	O
exist	O

I	O
once	O

Billy	B-Billy_Graham

to	O
a	O

question	O

“	O

straight	O
after	O
the	O
pre-season	O
defeat	O
at	O
Castleford	B-Castleford_Tigers
a	O
week	O

that	O

but	O
that	O

For	O
large	O
parts	O
of	O
this	O

the	O
Giants	B-Huddersfield_Giants
looked	O
disjointed	O
on	O

on	O

which	O

Foster	B-Ian_Foster_(footballer)

One	O
problem	O

was	O
that	O

against	O

was	O
significantly	O
worse	O

That	O
's	O
a	O

cricket	O
is	O
at	O
a	O
crossroads	O
.	O

Does	O
it	O
go	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
football	O
and	O
allow	O
the	O
moneyed	O
clubs	O
to	O
procure	O
all	O
the	O
best	O
and	O

young	O

thus	O
making	O
any	O
battle	O
for	O

a	O
three	O

?	O

Does	O
it	O
want	O
to	O
lose	O
its	O
long	O
and	O
proud	O
tradition	O
whereby	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
18	O
counties	O
can	O
realistically	O
win	O
the	O
Championship	B-EFL_Championship
?	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
does	O
our	O
summer	O
game	O
want	O
to	O
fully	O
embrace	O
capitalism	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
free-market	O
obligations	O
that	O
that	O
entails	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
most	O
fans	O
of	O
the	O
county	O
game	O
would	O
answer	O
no	O
to	O
those	O
questions	O
.	O

We	O
want	O
to	O
retain	O
the	O
competitiveness	O
that	O
has	O
given	O
us	O
gripping	O
climaxes	O
to	O
last	O
two	O
county	O
seasons	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
charmed	O
by	O
the	O
heart-warming	O
stories	O
of	O
cash-strapped	O
clubs	O
being	O
led	O
to	O
title	O
glory	O
by	O
long-serving	O
and	O
loyal	O
legends	O
of	O
the	O
game	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
solution	O
?	O

Winston	B-Winston_Churchill
Churchill	I-Winston_Churchill
once	O
said	O
that	O
capitalism	O
is	O
the	O
unequal	O
sharing	O
of	O
blessings	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
cricket	O
clubs	O
those	O
blessings	O
are	O
the	O
likes	O
of	O
the	O
Taylors	O
,	O
the	O
Denlys	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
who	O

in	O
the	O
future	O
,	O
the	O
Shiv	O
Thakors	O
and	O
the	O
Reece	O
Topleys	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
normal	O
profession	O
those	O
players	O
would	O
naturally	O
gravitate	O
towards	O
the	O
best	O
paid	O
jobs	O
and	O
leave	O
their	O
educators	O
,	O
usually	O
the	O
state	O
,	O
behind	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
then	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
reward	O
those	O
educators	O
for	O
their	O
efforts	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
taxes	O
and	O
that	O
money	O
would	O
then	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
train	O
the	O
next	O
generation	O
--	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
cycle	O
continues	O
.	O

In	O
cricket	O
,	O
unlike	O
even	O
in	O
premiership	O
football	O
-	O
that	O
Mecca	B-Mecca

best	O
and	O
brightest	O
young	O

to	O
the	O
Manchester	O

of	O

meaning	O
that	O
they	O

a	O
gradual	O
depletion	O
of	O
their	O

the	O
problems	O
to	O

.	O

Until	O
recently	O
,	O
this	O
lack	O
of	O
reward	O
did	O
n’t	O
matter	O
as	O

were	O

the	O

That	O
has	O
all	O
changed	O
over	O

nothing	O

the	O
view	O
that	O
county	O
cricket	O
is	O
sleepwalking	O
into	O
a	O
two-tier	O
oblivion	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
only	O
answer	O
is	O
to	O
adopt	O
a	O
transfer	O
system	O
similar	O
to	O
that	O
used	O
in	O
football	O
--	O
only	O
to	O
perhaps	O
go	O
further	O
--	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
smaller	O
counties	O
can	O
be	O
compensated	O
for	O
their	O
losses	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
principle	O
aim	O
of	O
counties	O
--	O
unlike	O
for	O

is	O
not	O
to	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O

many	O

their	O

This	O

You	O
see	O
,	O
far	O
too	O
many	O

that	O

an	O

“	O

But	O
what	O
they	O
‘	O
re	O

is	O
that	O
horror	O
is	O
about	O

ideas	O
,	O
challenging	O

who	O
was	O
once	O
a	O
contract	O

in	O
Chicago	B-Chicago

He	O
eventually	O
tired	O

the	O

of	O
meeting	O
project	O
goals	O
and	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
finding	O
another	O

so	O
he	O
worked	O
nights	O
as	O
a	O
janitor	O
in	O

Soon	O
he	O
hired	O

the	O
janitorial	O
work	O
and	O
continually	O
expanded	O
to	O
more	O
and	O
more	O

Today	O
he	O
has	O

spends	O
much	O
of	O
his	O

in	O

At	O
age	O
20	O
,	O
his	O
truck	O
went	O
out	O
of	O
control	O
as	O
he	O
tried	O
to	O
avoid	O
hitting	O
a	O
herd	O
of	O
horses	O

After	O
two	O
long	O
years	O
of	O

with	O
a	O
spinal	O

what	O
to	O

the	O

be	O

watch	O

which	O

The	O
worst	O
thing	O
a	O

As	O
the	O
fall	O
2011	O
semester	O
is	O
just	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
,	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
take	O

this	O
time	O
to	O
introduce	O
a	O
new	O
initiative	O
of	O
the	O
Office	O
of	O
the	O
Provost	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
metrics	O
of	O
our	O
vision	O
of	O
K-State	O
2025	O
concerns	O
the	O
number	O

of	O
faculty	O
members	O
who	O
receive	O
national	O
awards	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
years	O
,	O

K-State	O
has	O
had	O
very	O
few	O
faculty	O
members	O
receive	O
such	O
awards	O
.	O

Part	O
of	O

the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
very	O
few	O
faculty	O
members	O
have	O
been	O
nominated	O
or	O

have	O
applied	O
for	O
these	O
awards	O
.	O

We	O
believe	O
we	O
have	O
many	O
outstanding	O

scholars	O
at	O
K-State	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
awards	O
are	O
only	O
possible	O
if	O
we	O
nominate	O

them	O
.	O

My	O
office	O
has	O
put	O
together	O
a	O
website	O

--	O
http://www.k-state.edu/provost/resources/natlawards.htm —	O

lists	O

application	O
process	O
.	O

The	O
awards	O
are	O

listed	O
chronologically	O
by	O
their	O
application	O

.	O

We	O

wanted	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
information	O
available	O
early	O
enough	O
so	O
that	O

faculty	O
,	O

can	O
have	O
adequate	O
time	O
to	O

prepare	O
nominations	O
and	O
applications	O
.	O

We	O
hope	O
that	O
this	O
information	O

will	O
generate	O
the	O
interest	O
necessary	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
top	O
scholars	O
from	O

across	O
the	O
university	O
will	O
be	O
considered	O
for	O
and	O
eventually	O
receive	O

these	O
prestigious	O
awards	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
awards	O
are	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
longtime	O
scholars	O
.	O

They	O
vary	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O

What	O
are	O
the	O
secrets	O
to	O
surviving	O
a	O
recession	O
--	O
and	O
maybe	O
even	O
prospering	O
in	O
an	O
adverse	O
environment	O
as	O
an	O
entrepreneur	O
?	O

Me	O
:	O

That	O
partly	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
recession	O
.	O

This	O
one	O
is	O
different	O
from	O
recent	O
downturns	O
and	O
stock	O
market	O
declines	O
in	O
three	O
important	O
ways	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
of	O
inflation	O
.	O

Oil	O
has	O
already	O
hit	O
record	O
highs	O
this	O
year	O
.	O

Gold	O
is	O
on	O
its	O
way	O
to	O
$	O
1,000	O
an	O
ounce	O
.	O

And	O
a	O
gallon	O
of	O
gas	O
is	O
costing	O
$	O
4	O
in	O
some	O
states	O
.	O

Agricultural	O
prices	O
are	O
going	O
up	O
too	O
.	O

One	O
figure	O
I	O
saw	O
had	O
inflation	O
pegged	O
at	O
6.8	O
percent	O
on	O
an	O
annual	O
basis	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
three	O
months	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
actually	O
worse	O
than	O
that	O
.	O

Because	O
that	O
figure	O
was	O
based	O
on	O
government-supplied	O
data	O
.	O

Our	O
government	O
has	O
made	O
an	O
art	O
of	O
obfuscation	O
--	O
of	O
hiding	O
certain	O
economic	O
realities	O
.	O

Inflation	O
is	O
already	O
eating	O
away	O
at	O
our	O
buying	O
power	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
bad	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
getting	O
worse	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
falling	O
dollar	O
.	O

The	O
dollar	O
is	O
weaker	O
now	O
than	O
it	O
has	O
ever	O
been	O
in	O
history	O
.	O

That	O
makes	O
foreign	O
goods	O
more	O
expensive	O
.	O

Which	O
increases	O
inflation	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
bright	O
side	O
,	O
it	O
makes	O
US	B-United_States
manufactured	O
goods	O
more	O
attractive	O
as	O
exports	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
most	O
areas	O
,	O
we	O
still	O
ca	O
n’t	O
compete	O
,	O
price-wise	O
,	O
with	O
China	B-China
,	O
India	B-India
,	O
and	O
the	O
Third	B-Third_World
World	I-Third_World
.	O

The	O
third	O
way	O
this	O
downturn	O
is	O
different	O
is	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
debt	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
modern	O
history	O
,	O
American	B-United_States
consumers	O
owe	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
have	O
.	O

Credit	O
card	O
debt	O
has	O
skyrocketed	O
.	O

Mortgage	O
debt	O
,	O
which	O
increased	O
enormously	O
during	O
the	O
past	O
10	O
years	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
irresponsible	O
loans	O
,	O
is	O
now	O
at	O
a	O
crisis	O
point	O
because	O
real	O
estate	O
values	O
have	O
fallen	O
,	O
making	O
tens	O
of	O
thousands	O
of	O
loans	O
untenable	O
.	O

It	O
makes	O
more	O
sense	O
to	O
walk	O
away	O
from	O
these	O
loans	O
than	O
to	O
renegotiate	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
behind	O
all	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
federal	O
debt	O
--	O
which	O
has	O
skyrocketed	O
because	O
of	O
runaway	O
spending	O
by	O
an	O
earmark-addicted	O
Congress	B-United_States_Congress
and	O

These	O
are	O
our	O
economic	O
weaknesses	O
--	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
big	O
weaknesses	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
are	O
strengths	O
too	O
.	O

Unemployment	O
numbers	O
are	O
relatively	O
low	O
.	O

Earnings	O
are	O
relatively	O
good	O
.	O

And	O
new	O
business	O
start-ups	O
--	O
which	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
always	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
indicator	O
--	O
are	O
still	O
strong	O
.	O

Unemployment	O
will	O
certainly	O
increase	O
in	O
some	O
sectors	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
already	O
a	O
fact	O
in	O
the	O
real	O
estate	O
market	O
and	O
will	O
become	O
a	O
factor	O
in	O
banking	O
and	O
the	O
financial	O
industries	O
that	O
support	O
real	O
estate	O
.	O

But	O
other	O
sectors	O
of	O
the	O
economy	O
are	O
okay	O
for	O
the	O
moment	O
.	O

They	O
may	O
absorb	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
.	O

And	O
new	O
businesses	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
create	O
jobs	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
always	O
have	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
amazing	O
growth	O
of	O
the	O
Internet	O
.	O

What	O
all	O
that	O
amounts	O
to	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
book	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
period	O
stagflation	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
recession	O
but	O
may	O
simply	O
continue	O
to	O
exist	O
until	O

Stagflation	O
"	O
was	O
coined	O
ages	O
ago	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
college	O
.	O

It	O
describes	O
an	O
economic	O
period	O
of	O
both	O
inflation	O
and	O
flat	O
growth	O
.	O

The	O
best	O
description	O
I	O
’ve	O
heard	O
was	O
provided	O
by	O
Rich	O
Karlgaard	O
,	O
publisher	O
of	O
Forbes	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
:	O
"	O

Stagflation	O
is	O
present	O
when	O
gas	O
and	O
grocery	O
prices	O
are	O
rising	O
faster	O
than	O
your	O
paycheck	O
is	O
--	O
and	O
in	O
an	O
economy	O
that	O
is	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
employ	O
you	O
but	O
not	O
strong	O
enough	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
emboldened	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
a	O
raise	O
.	O
"	O

There	O
are	O
three	O
ways	O
to	O
defeat	O
stagflation	O
:	O
(	O
1	O
)	O
Tighten	O
the	O
money	O
supply	O
.	O

(	O
2	O
)	O
Restrict	O
credit	O
.	O

(	O
3	O
)	O
Lower	O
taxes	O
.	O

When	O
too	O
much	O
money/too-easy	O
credit	O
is	O
driving	O
up	O
prices	O
--	O
that	O
’s	O
classic	O
monetary	O
inflation	O
.	O

This	O
should	O
tell	O
the	O
Fed	B-Federal_Reserve
to	O
restrict	O
the	O
printing	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
tighten	O
credit	O
.	O

But	O
so	O
far	O
they	O
’ve	O
been	O
doing	O
the	O
opposite	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
afraid	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
tighten	O
credit	O
,	O
the	O
economy	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
already	O
weak	O
,	O
will	O
collapse	O

Lowering	O
taxes	O

taxes	O
on	O
individual	O
and	O
corporate	O
income	O
,	O
capital	O
gains	O
,	O
and	O
dividends	O
would	O
grow	O
the	O
economy	O
by	O
encouraging	O
investment	O
and	O
stimulating	O
production	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
classic	O
supply-side	O
economics	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
’s	O
very	O
unpopular	O
today	O
.	O

The	O
common	O
view	O
is	O
that	O
tax	O
cuts	O
reduce	O
the	O
effectiveness	O
of	O
government	O
and	O
increase	O
government	O
debt	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
evidence	O
contradicts	O
this	O
.	O

Government	O
receipts	O
usually	O
go	O
up	O
after	O
tax	O
cuts	O
because	O
the	O
economy	O
grows	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
income	O
and	O
profits	O
to	O
tax	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
reduce	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
doing	O
something	O
,	O
you	O
tend	O
to	O
get	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
thing	O
.	O

Reduce	O
the	O
tax	O
costs	O
of	O
production	O
in	O
America	B-United_States
and	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
more	O
production	O
.	O

More	O
production	O
means	O
more	O
goods	O
and	O
services	O
competing	O
for	O
your	O
dollars	O
.	O
"	O

That	O
’s	O
how	O
prices	O
go	O
down	O
,	O
not	O
up	O
,	O
"	O
says	O
Rich	O
Karlgaard	O
.	O

It	O
’s	O
simple	O
.	O

Supply	O
and	O
demand	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
prices	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
,	O
increase	O
the	O
supply	O
.	O

Incentivize	O
the	O
suppliers	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
’s	O
probably	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
because	O
it	O
’s	O
not	O
politically	O
expedient	O
for	O
politicians	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

Chances	O
are	O
our	O
problems	O
will	O
be	O
cured	O
by	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
negative	O
or	O
flat	O
growth	O
along	O
with	O
inflation	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
solution	O
preferred	O
by	O
politicians	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
way	O
for	O

consumers	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O

Chris	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
a	O
huge	O
personal	O
crisis	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
he	O
regretted	O
his	O
lonely	O
life	O
,	O
confined	O
to	O
a	O
ranch	O
in	O
the	O
desert	O
with	O
Timbo	B-Timbaland
.	O

He	O
shaved	O
his	O
long	O
beard	O
,	O
sold	O
his	O
beloved	O
chopper	O
and	O
stopped	O
polishing	O
his	O
meticulously	O

if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
manage	O
to	O
pull	O
himself	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
deep	O
depression	O
.	O

As	O
filming	O
progressed	O
,	O
he	O
gradually	O
found	O
his	O
balance	O
again	O

He	O
started	O
his	O

again	O

grew	O
his	O

back	O

bought	O
a	O

at	O

never	O

need	O
such	O
modern	O
amenities	O
as	O
credit	O
cards	O

computers	O
or	O

Not	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
adverse	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
busy	O
with	O
other	O
more	O
important	O
things	O
.	O

To	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
represented	O
a	O

of	O
primal	O
creature	O
with	O

instinctive	O
kind	O
of	O
wisdom	O

Jolissaint	B-Christiane_Jolissaint
could	O
not	O

a	O
fighter	O

though	O

and	O
despite	O
surrendering	O
the	O

she	O

to	O
return	O

the	O
level	O
of	O

when	O
she	O
won	O
the	O

Nevertheless	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
still	O
too	O

even	O
if	O
the	O

the	O

thought	O
Voegele	O
played	O
way	O
above	O
her	O
ranking	O
of	O
No.	O
138	O
in	O
defeating	O
Gajdosova	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
had	O
never	O
met	O
before	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
tentative	O
about	O
their	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
match	O
.	O

Partly	O
because	O
the	O
clay	O
court	O
here	O
is	O
much	O
quicker	O
than	O
most	O
and	O
partly	O
because	O
of	O
Gajdosova	O
’s	O
hit-and-miss	O
style	O
the	O
match	O
turned	O
into	O
the	O
tennis	O
equivalent	O
of	O
a	O
slugfest	O
.	O

After	O
losing	O
the	O
first	O
set	O
60	O
there	O
seemed	O
no	O
way	O
back	O
for	O
the	O
Australian	B-Australia
but	O
in	O
an	O
amazing	O
about-turn	O
she	O
raced	O
into	O
a	O
5-1	O
lead	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
set	O
.	O

Both	O
players	O
ruthlessly	O
punished	O
their	O
opponent	O
’s	O
second	O
serve	O
and	O
even	O
,	O
on	O
occasion	O
,	O
the	O
first	O

Then	O
Voegele	O
won	O
the	O
next	O
four	O
games	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
brave	O
man	O
who	O
could	O
predict	O
the	O
outcome	O
of	O
this	O
match	O
.	O

Even	O
the	O
second	O
set	O
tiebreak	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
twists	O
and	O
turns	O
,	O
Gajdosova	O
taking	O
a	O
4-0	O
lead	O
before	O
pegged	O
back	O
to	O
6-6	O
.	O

She	O
eventually	O
managed	O
to	O
win	O
it	O
10-8	O
.	O

The	O
deciding	O
set	O
continued	O
in	O
the	O

fashion	O

It	O
was	O

--	O
that	O

is	O
actually	O
a	O

I	O
believe	O
this	O

That	O

the	O

as	O

this	O

So	O

those	O

I	O

my	O

I	O

a	O

all	O

It	O
’s	O
almost	O
Halloween	B-Halloween
and	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
yet	O
bowed	O
down	O
to	O

If	O
you	O
’re	O
scared	O
of	O
email	O
for	O
your	O
kids	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
surprisingly	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
them	O
to	O

there	O
are	O
a	O
million	O

all	O
willing	O
to	O

Apple	B-Apple_Inc.
’s	O

And	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O
kiddy	O
email	O
sites	O
that	O
allow	O
your	O
infant	O
a	O
happy	O

to	O

on	O
lots	O
of	O
letters	O
without	O
messing	O
up	O
the	O
computer	O
too	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
progress	O
up	O
to	O
age	O
8	O
,	O
9	O
,	O
or	O
maybe	O
10	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
waited	O
until	O
your	O
daughter	O
is	O
almost	O
12	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
an	O
email	O
,	O
she	O
will	O
cry	O

as	O
mine	O
did	O

she	O
go	O
to	O
a	O

Zilladog	O

her	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
’s	O
a	O
sorry	O

,	O

we	O
’ll	O

get	O

and	O
monitor	O
it	O
ourselves	O
until	O
she	O
is	O
a	O

I	O

not	O

Still	O

there	O

this	O
Christmas	B-Christmas

I	O
bought	O

a	O

of	O
imitation	O

last	O
year	O
which	O
wore	O
Gianmarco	O
Lorenzi	O
Wedges	O
out	O
so	O
now	O
she	O
wants	O
the	O
real	O
deal	O
.	O

My	O
question	O
is	O
:	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
egg	O
boots	O
,	O
emu	O
boots	O
,	O
bear	O
paw	O

and	O
sheepskin	O

?	O

These	O
are	O
words	O
that	O
came	O
up	O
as	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
do	O
my	O
research	O
...	O
and	O
I	O
'll	O
be	O
honest	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
spend	O
$	O
100	O
plus	O
dollars	O
Cheap	O
Christian	O
Louboutin	O
on	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
boots	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
'm	O
looking	O
at	O

Ugg	O
Gianmarco	O
Lorenzi	O
Ankle	O
Boots	O
boots	O
...	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
before	O
the	O
name	O
was	O
trademarked	O
it	O
was	O
Aussie	B-Australia
slang	O
for	O
ugly	O
?	O

Apparently	O
these	O
boots	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
for	O
over	O
200	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
land	O
down	O
under	O

Designed	O
to	O
be	O
worn	O
to	O
be	O
comfy	O
and	O
warm	O
...	O
more	O
function	O
than	O
fashion	O
.	O

A	O
closer	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
design	O
though	O
reveals	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
cozy	O
boot	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
Ug	B-Uganda
,	O
Ugh	O
or	O
UGGs	O
they	O
be	O
made	O
of	O
100	O
%	O
Australian	B-Australia
Merino	O
Sheepskin	O
.	O

This	O
gives	O
the	O
boot	O
their	O
famous	O
fit	O
and	O
durability	O
,	O
soft	O
and	O
snugly	O
like	O
a	O
sock	O
but	O
be	O
tough	O
enough	O
to	O
worn	O
outdoors	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
unique	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
Ug	B-Uganda
boot	O
is	O
the	O
fleece	O
lining	O
.	O

Australians	B-Australia
are	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
worn	O
these	O
year	O
round	O
.	O

The	O
soft	O
lining	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
trap	O
in	O
body	O
heat	O
like	O
goose	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
cold	O
weather	O
.	O

Yet	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
hot	O
Australian	B-Australia
summers	O
you	O
Gianmarco	O
Lorenzi	O
Pumps	O
could	O
still	O
wear	O
your	O
ugly	O
boots	O
around	O
because	O
the	O
natural	O
fibers	O
pull	O
the	O
perspiration	O
away	O
from	O
your	O
body	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
these	O
boots	O
do	O
sound	O
pretty	O
Gianmarco	O
Lorenzi	O
Boots	O
cool	O
;	O
no	O
wonder	O
they	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
fans	O
!	O

Still	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
these	O
trademarked	O
UGG	O
boots	O
are	O
all	O
about	O
why	O
are	O
they	O
so	O
expensive	O
when	O
the	O
old	O
genuine	O
ug	O
's	O
were	O
20	O
to	O
30	O
dollars	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
in	O
reality	O
it	O
all	O
comes	O
down	O
to	O
marketing	O
...	O

The	O
trade	O
named	O

In	O
a	O
foreword	O

TCD	B-Trinity_College_Dublin
Emeritus	O
Professor	O
George	O
Huxley	O
describes	O
Dr	O
Cronin	O
as	O
a	O
scholar	O
by	O
vocation	O
and	O
a	O
countryman	O
at	O
heart	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
combined	O
his	O
boyhood	O
insights	O
with	O
his	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
Greek	B-Greece
language	O
.	O

But	O
his	O
rural	O
upbringing	O
helped	O
him	O
in	O
another	O
way	O
--	O
while	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
research	O
was	O
carried	O
out	O
at	O
his	O
desk	O
and	O
in	O
academic	O
libraries	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
easily	O
identify	O
with	O
the	O
old	O
people	O
he	O
interviewed	O
in	O
the	O
Greek	B-Greece
countryside	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
from	O
farmers	O
,	O
shepherds	O
,	O
and	O
sailors	O
that	O
he	O
learned	O
a	O
deal	O
about	O
Greek	B-Greece
weather	O
lore	O
.	O

His	O
book	O
contains	O
a	O
catalogue	O
of	O

720	O

The	O
crucial	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
for	O
agriculture	O
is	O
recognised	O
in	O
an	O
ancient	O
Greek	B-Greece
proverb	O
with	O
a	O
universal	O
application	O
--	O
it	O
is	O
the	O

not	O
the	O

.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
predictions	O
in	O
Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland
and	O
Greece	B-Greece
are	O
based	O
on	O
observation	O
of	O
birds	O
,	O
animals	O
,	O
insects	O
and	O
fish	O
,	O
the	O
sun	O
and	O
the	O

The	O
Greeks	B-Greece
,	O
however	O
,	O
use	O
far	O
more	O
signs	O
from	O
animals	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
than	O
we	O
do	O
,	O
though	O
some	O
signs	O
are	O
common	O
to	O
both	O
countries	O

One	O
is	O
that	O
gulls	O
fly	O
in	O

the	O

.	O

Another	O
is	O
that	O

are	O
a	O

Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland

The	O

belief	O
common	O
to	O
Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland
,	O
Greece	B-Greece
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
countries	O
is	O
that	O
if	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
rain	O
.	O

This	O
sign	O
is	O
reliable	O
,	O
he	O
remarks	O
.	O

Swallows	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
catch	O
insects	O
at	O
high	O
levels	O
in	O
fine	O
weather	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
the	O

humid	O
,	O
just	O
prior	O
to	O
rain	O
,	O
insects	O
remain	O

that	O

I	O

if	O

with	O

In	O

you	O
state	O
that	O

requested	O
a	O

through	O
which	O
you	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
refinance	O
your	O
first	O

First	O
,	O
you	O
should	O
understand	O
that	O
demanding	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

is	O
not	O

The	O

(	O

and	O
how	O
the	O

will	O
affect	O
this	O

It	O
will	O
also	O

to	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
"	O
upside-down	O

on	O
the	O
property	O
(	O
you	O
owe	O
more	O
that	O
the	O

)	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
in	O
this	O
position	O
significantly	O
increases	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
default	O
on	O
one	O
or	O
all	O
of	O
your	O
mortgage	O
obligations	O

Here	O
,	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
the	O

has	O
refused	O
to	O
subordinate	O
,	O
and	O
refused	O
to	O
refund	O
the	O
appraisal	O
fee	O
paid	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
recourse	O
in	O
this	O

are	O

In	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
twenty	O

Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland

However	O
the	O
debate	O
on	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
make	O
our	O
exporting	O
sector	O
smarter	O
has	O
continued	O
in	O
what	O
is	O
an	O
increasingly	O
redundant	O
debate	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
these	O
issues	O
have	O
been	O
resolved	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

Should	O
we	O
or	O
shouldn	O

active	O

policy	O

Answer	O
:	O
We	O

Should	O
we	O
turn	O
our	O
back	O
on	O

on	O

?	O

Answer	O
:	O
No	O
we	O
should	O
n’t	O

nor	O
will	O
we	O

Why	O
then	O
do	O
policymakers	O
still	O
focus	O
on	O
exporters	O
?	O

The	O
reason	O
is	O
simple	O
.	O

Productivity	O
growth	O
destroys	O
as	O
it	O
creates	O
.	O

Improving	O
productivity	O
requires	O
out-dated	O

be	O
swept	O
away	O
,	O
companies	O
to	O
transform	O
and	O
workers	O
to	O

.	O

It	O
’s	O
difficult	O
,	O
often	O
unpopular	O
,	O
yet	O
crucial	O
for	O
long-run	O
economic	O
health	O
.	O

However	O
when	O
we	O
create	O
an	O
exporting	O
operation	O
in	O
Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland
,	O
the	O
pain	O
is	O

Promoting	O
export	O

is	O
a	O
one-way	O
bet	O
,	O
and	O
avoids	O
having	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
really	O
difficult	O
decisions	O
.	O

What	O
our	O
exporters	O
really	O
need	O
now	O
is	O

to	O
reduce	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
operating	O
a	O
business	O
from	O
Ireland	B-Republic_of_Ireland

The	O
source	O

recognize	O
and	O
respond	O
appropriately	O
to	O
ethical	O
dilemmas	O
encountered	O
while	O
treating	O

is	O
a	O
complex	O
task	O
that	O
can	O

for	O

set	O
of	O
principles	O
that	O
can	O

to	O
evaluate	O
ethically	O
challenging	O
situations	O

Numerous	O
written	O
codes	O
of	O
ethical	O

with	O
day-to-day	O

There	O
is	O

an	O
important	O
difference	O
between	O

A	O
set	O
of	O
common	O
principles	O
derived	O
from	O
these	O
various	O
codes	O
must	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
broad	O
enough	O
to	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
the	O
rich	O
variety	O
of	O
practice	O

Any	O
less	O
inclusive	O
formula	O
for	O
determining	O
whether	O
a	O
counselor	O
's	O
behavior	O
is	O
ethically	O
appropriate	O
requires	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
context	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
occurs	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
vigorously	O
challenging	O
a	O
client	O
's	O
beliefs	O
or	O
behaviors	O
may	O
be	O
ethically	O

under	O
one	O

of	O
circumstances	O
but	O
not	O
another	O

Similarly	O

different	O
counselors	O
may	O
respond	O
to	O
an	O
identical	O
ethical	O
dilemma	O
in	O
very	O
distinct	O
yet	O
equally	O
justifiable	O
ways	O

What	O
follows	O
are	O
six	O
core	O
ethical	O
guidelines	O
that	O
are	O
sufficiently	O
broad	O
and	O
context-free	O
to	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
useful	O
frame	O
of	O

Informed	O
consent	O

Informed	O
consent	O
is	O
the	O
fundamental	O
bedrock	O
of	O
ethical	O
practice	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
helps	O
to	O
solidify	O
the	O
client	O
's	O
autonomy	O
in	O
matters	O
that	O
affect	O
the	O
entire	O
course	O
and	O
direction	O
of	O
counseling	O

Counselors	O
may	O
not	O
always	O
fully	O
appreciate	O
the	O
lengths	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
to	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
important	O
decisions	O
about	O
treatment	O
issues	O
are	O
truly	O
made	O
from	O
a	O
basis	O
of	O
informed	O
choice	O

Rather	O
than	O
being	O
a	O
one-time	O
event	O
,	O
informed	O
consent	O
is	O
an	O
on-going	O
collaborative	O
effort	O
between	O
client	O
and	O
counselor	O
for	O
establishing	O
and	O
continuously	O
monitoring	O
the	O
goals	O
and	O
strategies	O
of	O
counseling	O

A	O
client	O
has	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
know	O
which	O
treatment	O
modalities	O
an	O
addiction	O
counselor	O
typically	O
recommends	O

and	O
so	O
forth	O

Counselors	O
often	O
do	O
n't	O
take	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
explicitly	O
discuss	O
the	O
expected	O
benefits	O
and	O
potential	O

of	O

approaches	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
available	O
to	O
the	O
client	O

Informed	O
consent	O
also	O
includes	O
information	O
about	O
the	O
anticipated	O
duration	O
of	O
treatment	O

any	O
situations	O
that	O
could	O
result	O

counselor	O
prematurely	O
terminating	O
services	O

clients	O
should	O
know	O
the	O
policy	O
for	O

disputes	O

well	O
as	O
all	O
pertinent	O
financial	O
aspects	O
of	O
the	O
counseling	O
relationship	O

counselors	O
should	O
also	O
be	O

Due	O
to	O
the	O
large	O
volume	O
this	O
information	O
may	O
constitute	O
,	O
the	O
counselor	O
may	O
choose	O
to	O
convey	O
it	O
by	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
verbal	O
and	O
written	O
means	O
.	O

A	O
client	O
's	O
informed	O
consent	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
itself	O
sufficient	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O
a	O
counselor	O
's	O
behavior	O
is	O
ethical	O

It	O
's	O
conceivable	O
that	O
clients	O
might	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
give	O
their	O
approval	O
to	O
any	O
number	O
of	O
ethically	O
inappropriate	O
behaviors	O
,	O
so	O
a	O
counselor	O
needs	O
other	O
core	O
principles	O
to	O
guide	O
the	O
ethical	O
decision-making	O
process	O
.	O

Competence	O
and	O
established	O
theory	O

A	O
counselor	O
has	O
an	O
ethical	O
responsibility	O
to	O
practice	O
only	O
within	O
the	O
scope	O
of	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
professional	O
competence	O
.	O

Some	O
typical	O
indicators	O
of	O
competence	O
include	O
education	O
,	O
experience	O
,	O
training	O
,	O
and	O
certification	O
(	O

Competence	O
in	O
one	O
clinical	O
area	O
does	O
n't	O
necessarily	O
translate	O
to	O
another	O
.	O

Counselors	O
with	O
extensive	O
experience	O
treating	O
general	O
psychiatric	O
disorders	O
are	O
n't	O
necessarily	O
competent	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
specific	O
needs	O
of	O
addicted	O
clients	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
addiction	O
counselors	O
without	O
advanced	O
training	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
adequately	O
recognize	O
signs	O
of	O
psychiatric	O
disorders	O
.	O

Cross-referral	O
between	O
such	O
specialists	O
is	O
necessary	O
in	O
such	O
situations	O
.	O

One	O
often-overlooked	O
component	O
of	O
competency	O
is	O
a	O
counselor	O
's	O
ability	O
to	O
clearly	O
describe	O
the	O
theoretical	O
basis	O
for	O
providing	O
a	O
particular	O
clinical	O
service	O
.	O

Just	O
because	O
a	O
client	O
's	O
case	O
turned	O
out	O
all	O
right	O
does	O
n't	O
necessarily	O
justify	O
a	O
counselor	O
's	O
actions	O
if	O
they	O
otherwise	O
lack	O
adequate	O
theoretical	O
support	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
right	O
thing	O
for	O
the	O
right	O
reason	O
,	O
not	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
right	O
result	O
.	O

Counselors	O
operating	O
without	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
a	O
clear	O
theory	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
rely	O
too	O
much	O
on	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
intuition	O
,	O
habit	O
,	O
consensus	O
and	O
personal	O
preference	O

.	O

Clients	O
deserve	O
the	O
knowledge	O
and	O
right	O
to	O
accept	O
or	O
reject	O
treatment	O
that	O
represents	O
a	O
particular	O
theoretical	O
orientation	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
absence	O
of	O
information	O
to	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
clients	O
will	O
assume	O
that	O
whatever	O
form	O
of	O
counseling	O
they	O
are	O
receiving	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
available	O
or	O
appropriate	O
choice	O
.	O

Confidentiality	O

Another	O
core	O
ethical	O
principle	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
counselor	O
to	O
vigilantly	O
guard	O
against	O
unauthorized	O
disclosure	O
of	O
client	O
information	O
.	O

The	O
assurance	O
of	O
confidentiality	O
is	O
a	O
fundamental	O
guarantee	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
absolute	O
one	O
.	O

Several	O
ethical	O
dilemmas	O
involving	O
confidentiality	O
commonly	O
arise	O
in	O
the	O
treatment	O
of	O
addictive	O
disorders	O
:	O

Duty	O
to	O
Warn/Protect	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
widely	O
accepted	O
that	O
counselors	O
have	O
a	O
general	O
obligation	O
to	O
warn	O
or	O
protect	O
people	O
whom	O
a	O
client	O
places	O
in	O
imminent	O
harm	O
.	O

The	O
right	O
to	O
confidential	O
treatment	O
is	O
therefore	O
balanced	O
by	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
ensure	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
others	O
.	O

The	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
counseling	O
relationship	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
time	O
for	O
a	O
client	O
to	O
learn	O
about	O
these	O
limits	O
of	O
confidentiality	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
any	O
safeguards	O
necessary	O
to	O
protect	O
others	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
policies	O
on	O
notifying	O
law	O

Clients	O
who	O
inject	O
drugs	O
or	O
engage	O
in	O
sexually	O
risky	O
behavior	O
while	O
chemically	O
impaired	O
may	O
expose	O
others	O
to	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
HIV	O
infection	O

Courts	O
have	O
not	O
generally	O
applied	O
duty-to-warn	O
standards	O
to	O
these	O
situations	O

Balancing	O
the	O
counselor-client	O
relationship	O
with	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
at-risk	O
populations	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
complex	O
and	O
emotionally	O
charged	O
situation	O

Counselors	O
should	O
inform	O
clients	O
about	O
their	O
policy	O
for	O
dealing	O
with	O
HIV	B-HIV

concerns	O
that	O
arise	O

treatment	O

to	O
help	O
communicate	O
information	O
to	O
partners	O

and	O
consult	O
with	O
colleagues	O
as	O
deemed	O
appropriate	O

Minors	O
and	O
Families	O
.	O

All	O
states	O
require	O
counselors	O
to	O
report	O
situations	O
in	O
which	O
minors	O
are	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
harm	O
,	O
although	O
specific	O
state	O
statutes	O
differ	O
(	O

)	O
.	O

As	O
most	O
counselors	O
know	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
distinguish	O
potential	O
from	O
probable	O
risk	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
a	O
client	O
who	O
admits	O
to	O
blackouts	O
may	O
deny	O
that	O
she	O
places	O
her	O
children	O
in	O
any	O
danger	O
.	O

A	O
counselor	O
who	O
decides	O
not	O
to	O
notify	O
the	O
designated	O
reporting	O
agency	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	O
should	O
document	O
the	O
basis	O
for	O
this	O
decision	O
in	O
the	O
clinical	O
record	O
.	O

Consultation	O
in	O
these	O
situations	O
is	O
again	O
extremely	O
valuable	O
in	O
helping	O
a	O
counselor	O
maintain	O
much-needed	O
clinical	O
objectivity	O
.	O

Counselors	O
who	O
treat	O
minors	O
for	O
substance	O
use	O
disorders	O
need	O
to	O
clearly	O
establish	O
the	O
extent	O
to	O
which	O
parents	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
information	O
that	O
is	O
disclosed	O
by	O
their	O
children	O
.	O

A	O
minor	O
may	O
be	O
reluctant	O
to	O
talk	O
honestly	O
if	O
confidentiality	O
boundaries	O
are	O
not	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
therapeutic	O
alliance	O
may	O
be	O
crippled	O
if	O
a	O
counselor	O
who	O
is	O
unclear	O
on	O
the	O
limits	O
of	O
confidentiality	O
later	O
provides	O
information	O
to	O
parents	O
.	O

Counselors	O
should	O
be	O
familiar	O
with	O
federal	O
law	O
on	O
confidentiality	O
of	O
alcohol	O
and	O
drug	O
abuse	O
records	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
any	O
applicable	O
state	O
laws	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
seek	O
professional	O
consultation	O
whenever	O
questions	O
arise	O
.	O

A	O
major	O
ethical	O
concern	O
that	O
arises	O
when	O
counseling	O
couples	O

is	O
how	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
emergence	O

of	O
counseling	O
within	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
the	O
client	O
's	O
value	O
system	O
rather	O
than	O
attempting	O
to	O

those	O

If	O
a	O
counselor	O
finds	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
attempt	O
to	O
modify	O
a	O
client	O
's	O

this	O

Counselors	O
often	O
avoid	O
initiating	O
discussion	O
with	O
clients	O
about	O
the	O
ethical	O
dimensions	O
of	O
clinical	O
issues	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
this	O
reluctance	O
stems	O
from	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
appearing	O
moralistic	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
also	O
reflects	O
a	O
general	O
tendency	O
of	O
the	O
counseling	O
profession	O
to	O
be	O
ethically	O
inarticulate	O
.	O

It	O
takes	O
considerable	O
effort	O
and	O
skill	O
to	O
engage	O
in	O
thoughtful	O
dialogue	O
about	O
the	O
ethical	O
aspects	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
but	O
doing	O
so	O
can	O
have	O
great	O
benefit	O
for	O
clients	O
whose	O
history	O
of	O
addiction	O
is	O
marked	O
by	O
diminished	O
personal	O
integrity	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
does	O
not	O
guarantee	O
a	O
positive	O
clinical	O
outcome	O
,	O
it	O
does	O
foster	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
therapeutic	O
environment	O
for	O
a	O
client	O
to	O
utilize	O
the	O
counseling	O
experience	O
to	O
its	O
fullest	O
potential	O
.	O

These	O
guidelines	O
are	O
not	O
an	O
exhaustive	O
review	O
of	O
every	O
ethical	O
issue	O
related	O
to	O
addictions	O
counseling	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
substitute	O
for	O
a	O
counselor	O
's	O
knowledge	O
of	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
professional	O
code	O
of	O
conduct	O
.	O

Many	O
clinical	O
situations	O
require	O
a	O
more	O
detailed	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
ethical	O
issues	O
involved	O
or	O
compliance	O
with	O

us	O

the	O
good	O

of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
smaller	O
and	O
lighter	O
in	O

to	O

It	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
standard	O
normal	O
book	O
which	O
could	O
be	O
easily	O
carried	O
with	O
the	O
hand	O
.	O

Since	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
portable	O
,	O
an	O
individual	O
could	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
wherever	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
wants	O
to	O
travel	O
to	O

It	O
could	O
be	O
light	O

there	O
more	O

have	O
to	O
carry	O
a	O
separate	O

Another	O
advantage	O
is	O
that	O
it	O

Here	O
comes	O
the	O
downside	O
of	O

Although	O
it	O
is	O
fully	O

it	O
has	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
complications	O
too	O

I	O
’ve	O
noticed	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

“	O

,	O
sometimes	O
the	O
word	O
is	O
transcribed	O
with	O
an	O
“	O
a	O
”	O
sound	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
but	O
is	O
pronounced	O
without	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
vice	O

.	O

For	O

,	O
in	O
today	O
’s	O
lesson	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
word	O
“	O

a	O

Sorry	O
for	O
the	O
late	O

In	O
the	O
feminine	O
“	O
you	O

form	O
(	O
أنْتِ	O
)	O
,	O
verbs	O
end	O
with	O
a	O
fatHa	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
sound	O
“	O

For	O

“	O

Usually	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
verbs	O
are	O
followed	O
by	O
another	O
word	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
pronounce	O
the	O
grammatical	O
ending	O
“	O
a.	O
”	O
Otherwise	O
,	O
it	O
’s	O
optional	O
and	O
some	O
native	O
speakers	O
choose	O
not	O
to	O
pronounce	O
the	O
“	O
a	O
”	O
sound	O
when	O
the	O
phrase	O
ends	O
with	O
the	O
verb	O
.	O

It	O
sounds	O
more	O
natural	O

‘	O

(	O

that	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
,	O
the	O
Haraka	O
“	O

is	O
present	O

asked	O
if	O

donate	O
their	O

never	O

if	O
he	O
could	O

the	O

along	O
the	O
entire	O

In	O
1983	O

he	O
proved	O
for	O
the	O
first	O

“	O

So	O
I	O
was	O
gratified	O
to	O
hear	O
John	O
"	O
Plasmaboy	O
"	O
Wayland	O
talk	O
about	O
and	O
advocate	O
common	O
sense	O
strategies	O
for	O
converting	O
to	O
electric	O
with	O
out	O
the	O
appeal	O
to	O
magic	O
batteries	O
or	O
free	O
energy	O
ponzie	O
schemes	O
to	O
power	O
the	O
cars	O
.	O

One	O
thing	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
beg	O
to	O
differ	O
with	O
John	O
on	O
though	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
modern	O
cars	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
convert	O
and	O
he	O
discouraged	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
wrong	O
for	O
three	O
reasons	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
newer	O
cars	O
are	O
safer	O
cars	O
.	O

Older	O
cars	O
like	O
the	O
Volkswagen	B-Volkswagen_Golf
Rabbit	I-Volkswagen_Golf
of	O
the	O
1980s	O
have	O
no	O
airbags	O
,	O
reinforced	O
steel	O
doors	O
or	O
headrests	O
that	O
absorb	O
whiplash	O
and	O
are	O
therefore	O
death	O
traps	O
in	O
a	O
car	O
accident	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
trivial	O
matter	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
US	B-United_States
because	O
upwards	O
of	O
32,000	O
people	O
die	O
per	O
year	O
in	O
accidents	O
.	O

Part	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
driving	O
while	O
cellular	O
syndrome	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
pox	O
on	O
the	O
nation	O
.	O

Second	O
,	O
newer	O
cars	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
harder	O
to	O
convert	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
a	O
website	O
of	O
a	O
beautifully	O
converted	O
electric	O
Yaris	O
that	O
I	O
drooled	O
over	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
well	O
done	O
it	O
looked	O
factory	O
.	O

The	O
Yaris	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
'06	O
so	O
it	O
has	O
all	O
the	O
CANBUS	O
paraphernalia	O
in	O
it	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
converted	O
successfully	O
with	O
the	O
best	O
parts	O
availably	O
like	O
a	O
Netgain	O
Warp	O
9	O
series	O
DC	O
motor	O
,	O
a	O
1000	O
amp	O
Cafe	O
Electric	O
Zilla	O
controller	O
and	O
Exide	O
blue	O
maintenance	O
free	O
batteries	O
.	O

The	O
car	O
was	O
brand	O
new	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
converted	O
so	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
done	O
if	O
you	O
choose	O
a	O
car	O
without	O
all	O
the	O
bells	O
,	O
whistles	O
and	O
goo-gahs	O
onboard	O
.	O

Third	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
exception	O
of	O
the	O
Chevy	B-Chevrolet_S-10
S-10	I-Chevrolet_S-10
which	O
is	O
still	O
an	O
excellent	O
conversion	O
choice	O
even	O
if	O
GM	B-General_Motors
goes	O
into	O
the	O
drink	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
older	O
cars	O
that	O
John	O
talks	O
about	O
converting	O
like	O
the	O
Rabbit	O
of	O
the	O
'80s	O
will	O
undoubtedly	O
have	O
difficulty	O
obtaining	O
replacement	O
parts	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
CV	B-Curriculum_vitae
joints	O
,	O
tie	O
rods	O
,	O
springs	O
,	O
tail	O
light	O
lenses	O
,	O
seats	O
,	O
etc.	O
.	O

So	O
when	O
choosing	O
a	O
car	O
its	O
important	O
to	O
choose	O
one	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
replacement	O
parts	O
for	O
or	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
world	O
of	O
hurt	O
like	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
our	O
EV	B-EVS_Broadcast_Equipment
club	O
was	O
until	O
he	O
found	O
a	O
practically	O
pristine	O
1980	O
Plymouth	B-Dodge_Omni
Horizon	I-Dodge_Omni
he	O
could	O
cannibalize	O
for	O
parts	O
for	O
his	O
factory	O
converted	O
Horizon	B-Dodge_Omni
called	O
the	O
Jet	O
Electrica	O
007	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
just	O
one	O
other	O
minor	O
point	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
both	O
books	O
,	O
"	O
Convert	O
It	O
"	O
by	O
Michael	O
Brown	O
and	O
the	O
original	O
"	O
Build	O

"	O
book	O
by	O
Bob	O
Brant	O
and	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
Bob	O
Brant	O
book	O
more	O
because	O
it	O
explains	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
each	O
type	O
of	O
battery	O
and	O
electric	O
motor	O
in	O
detail	O
.	O

It	O
also	O
places	O
great	O
emphasis	O
on	O
the	O
proper	O
choice	O
of	O
vehicle	O
to	O
convert	O
based	O
on	O
vehicle	O
curb	O
weight	O
,	O
wind	O
drag	O
coefficient	O
and	O
capacitiy	O
for	O
storing	O
batteries	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
I	O
'm	O
a	O
ham	O

operator	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
now	O
you	O
know	O
why	O
I	O
like	O
Brant	O
's	O
book	O
more	O
.	O

But	O
John	O
has	O
a	O
valid	O
point	O
.	O

Michael	O
Brown	O
's	O
book	O
is	O
an	O
easier	O
read	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
most	O

Great	O

It	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
guys	O
like	O
John	O
Wayland	O
,	O
KiwiEv	O
,	O
and	O
many	O

that	O

me	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
many	O
others	O
to	O
do	O
there	O
conversions	O
.	O

Because	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
it	O
takes	O
forever	O
for	O
the	O
manufactures	O
to	O
catch	O
up	O
with	O

it	O

people	O

this	O
that	O
keep	O

We	O
also	O
had	O
the	O
Hillman	O

sold	O
here	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
1959	O
Hillman	O
Husky	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
teenager	O
and	O
I	O
sure	O

it	O

a	O

to	O

It	O
was	O
very	O

to	O
the	O

I	O
